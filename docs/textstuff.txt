DEVIL WARSHIP MAKUJIN

Makujin is a cosmic demon that devours space and time itself.
His black jaws appear all over the galaxy, brought by his smaller minions.

(кавер арт)

You will assume the role of Kinrunner, a living spaceship created by cosmic god Gokagu for the sole purpose of defeating Makujin.
The demon has transformed into a huge cybernetic space battleship. He has also brainwashed a number of wandering space pirates with his supreme mental power, to use them as a weapon against you.

Kinrunner has enough potential to beat the demon's minions thanks to its Saturnus cannon. But this weapon alone is hardly enough to defeat Makujin himself.
Fortunately, your ship can absorb the power that the demon uses to devour space. This power can be easily converted into various useful upgrades for the living ship. With them, you can surely defeat this fearsome devil.

Go forth, Kinrunner! There is no way back. Devil Warship Makujin awaits.
