---Postjam Todo List---








~~~~~Isn't complete, contains only forgettable non-immediate things~~~~~



---Implementions---
	1. Ask Vlad about extra boss mechanics
	6. Boss animations
	10. Boss OURGHH and AHHH for hit sound which play only if no sounds from group are played
	14. Menu screen
	15. Sinistar control scheme + config
	16. Gameover yes and no sound logic. 
			yes: yes sound
			no: no sound -> random no phrase from 15 bank -> 8 sec fade into gameover -> chill gamover music
	17. Continue screen loop music
	

---Tweaks---
	1. [Ok] Replace boss death sound with proper one; make boss children use the replaced sound
	2. Small asteroids control fix: vector change on turn+thrust isn't sudden, but gradual
	3. [Ok] Boss doesn't restore his flakes on reset
	4. Consider re-implementing shooting on standing. Althrough it's kinda lame, but maybe.. not so lame, but great?
	5. Fade-in for continue screen


---Misfeature fixes, bugs---
	3. Flying text may cause problems when it's several minutes into titles (simply introduce a limiting variable for endgame screen draw)
	4. Something is causing a massive memory leak everywhere from start to finish (even through several map and battle screens)
		something like +200mB/5 minutes; on game end all the accumulated stuff goes away before the actual game's unload
	5. Fix weapon timing (slight delay before next shot due to timer not being reset on shot end)
	6. Shoot/fly speeds are drastically different on each scale (x1 vs x5 to see). That's because of fixed coordinate system vs scaled sprites, yup.
	7. The black shadow hogs up inscreasingly more memory with more scale because it's not drawn scaled, but initialized scaled (it's also tied to problem #6)
	8. Minimap somehow doesn't spawn on center

~~~~~COMPLETED~~~~



---Implementions---
	2. [Ok] Dictionaty<Vector2 pos, int frameCounterToEnd> explosions (50 ms each frame)
	3. [Ok] Config file for volume/scale
	4. [Ok] Shield gone sound for shield descruction, shield up for recovery, stageclear for end stage
	5. [Ok] A system of stage continues
	7. [Ok] Boss round hitbox
	9. [Ok] Shader Fade-In 0-255 for game over screen (draw game screen on endgame too, but fill with Shader.Sillhouette(0-255) pixel, source-rected to screen size)
	12.[Ok] Sound system improvement (Explosions has hit-and-let-go attitude; play only after enemy remove; diff sounds for bullets)
	13.[Ok] Player kill, take damage and boss death sounds

---Tweaks---

---Misfeature fixes, bugs---
	1. [Ok] Shield can recover with sound in titles/map (simple fix: move shield recharge into Update())
	2. [Ok] Define black shadow drawing as source rect to reduce HUGE memory leak (Optimization Challenge)
